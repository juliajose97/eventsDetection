There is a small story behind every dish on the menu. The most famous one is about “Hünkar Beğendi” – a dish out of 100 chosen by the Sultan himself several decades ago. Culinary excellence with more than 70 Ottoman dishes will be provided by the best chef that Turkey has to offer: Chef Samil – all the way from Izmir. He is the master of Ottoman dishes, simple in design but amazing in taste. Enjoy Iftar for QAR155 per person and Sohour for QAR175 per person.\n\n2017-05-28\nvisitor\n\n",
